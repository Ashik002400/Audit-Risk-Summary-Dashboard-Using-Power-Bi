## 🎯 Key Insights & Findings

- **Rising Risk Trend**: Internal Control Weakness and Total Risk Scores have shown a consistent upward trend from 2021 to 2023.
- **Outliers Detected**: A small number of companies (e.g., `Company_242`) exhibit disproportionately high risk scores, indicating a need for targeted audit focus.
- **High Revenue vs High Risk**: Treemap visual shows high-revenue companies are also associated with higher audit risk metrics, suggesting a potential link between scale and risk exposure.
- **Control Breakdown Emphasis**: Dashboard avoids traditional audit terms like “control risk” or “inherent risk” in favor of practical terms like “internal control weakness” and “related party transaction,” improving clarity for non-technical users.
